# STM32F030TemperatureControl-
Temperature Control Device with User-Defined Settings
Description:

Introducing our Temperature Control Device, a smart and efficient solution designed to maintain your room at the perfect temperature. Developed using STM32CubeIDE for the STM32F030F4 module.

Key Features:

    Temperature Sensing: The system utilizes a thermistor to accurately measure the room temperature.

    User-Defined Temperature Settings: Users can easily set their desired room temperature through an intuitive interface provided by a 16x2 LCD module.

    Timer Functionality: The device includes a timer feature, enabling users to schedule the automatic shutdown of the output. Set the timer according to your preferences.
    STM32F030F4 Microcontroller: Powered by the STM32F030F4 microcontroller, this project benefits from its robust processing capabilities.
